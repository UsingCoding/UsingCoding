### :man_technologist: About Me :

I'm backend engineer from Russia.

* 🔥 I'm intresting in Kubernetes and cloud native solutions, like Prometheus, Grafana, K3S and e.t.c.

* 🐳 Intresting in Docker and docker solutions like BuildKit and VSCode devcontainers.

* Every day working with DDD and Clean Architecture principles

* I'm propagandize principle "**Docker everywhere**" - each my project properly dockerized(even mobile development projects). I think it's a cool principle that let achieve independent platform development and full project development workflow repetition.

* I have expreience in Frontend development with virtual DOM libraries like hyperHTML.

* Intresting in mobile development with Flutter, even when it was in beta.
